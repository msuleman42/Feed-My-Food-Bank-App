# Feed-My-Food-Bank-App
The Feed My Food Bank app has been designed to provide much needed assistance to communities, working hand in hand with established food banks. The app allows for a contact-free experience both when donating and requesting support from local food banks. The report outlines the design and use of the app. The Unified Modelling Language (UML) was used to help develop the Feed My Food Bank app.
